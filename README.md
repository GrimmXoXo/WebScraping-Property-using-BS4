# Web Scraping Script

## Overview

Welcome to the Web Scraping Script repository! This script is designed to efficiently gather real estate data from dynamic web pages. Below are the key features and points of emphasis in the script.

## Key Features

### 1. Exception Handling

The script is equipped with robust exception handling mechanisms. It can handle various exceptions such as timeouts, connection errors, and HTTP errors gracefully, ensuring the scraping process continues smoothly.

### 2. Session Management

Sessions are used to manage cookies effectively. By utilizing sessions, the script maintains a consistent user session and avoids potential issues related to cookie handling.

### 3. Proxy Management

The script employs Proxy Mesh to create a pool of multiple proxies, reducing the risk of IP bans. It dynamically handles proxy rotation, enhancing anonymity and minimizing the chances of being blocked by the target website.

### 4. Restart on Error

In case of an exception, the script intelligently restarts the scraping process from the point where it left off before the error occurred. This approach ensures minimal data loss and optimal resource utilization.

### 5. Null Data Handling

The script uses placeholder values to handle null or missing data. This ensures that the resulting data structures are consistent and can be processed without errors.

### 6. Efficient Time Complexity

The script is optimized for efficiency, employing algorithms with O(n) time complexity. This design choice ensures that the scraping process is both fast and resource-efficient.

### 7. Header Management

The script manages HTTP headers effectively, enhancing the authenticity of requests. Proper header management is crucial for bypassing anti-scraping measures employed by websites.

### 8. Proxy Extraction

The repository includes a proxy_extractor file, responsible for extracting free proxies. These proxies are then added to the proxy pool, expanding the available resources for scraping tasks.

### 9. CSV Data Management

The script creates and manages CSV files to store scraped data. If a previous CSV file exists, the script appends new data to it. If not, a new CSV file is created, ensuring data continuity and organization.

## Important Considerations

- **Proxy Security**: It's important to note that the script uses open proxies, which might have security vulnerabilities. Exercise caution when using these proxies for sensitive tasks.

- **Data Integrity**: While the script handles exceptions and errors effectively, always validate the integrity of the scraped data to ensure accuracy and consistency.

- **Continuous Monitoring**: Web scraping activities should be monitored regularly to adapt to website changes and ensure compliance with the website's terms of service.

## Getting Started

To get started with the script, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies specified in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Execute the main script and observe the scraping process in action.
4. Monitor the output and scraped data files for any issues or errors.

Happy scraping! If you have any questions or need assistance, feel free to reach out.

**Note:** This script is intended for educational purposes and should be used responsibly and ethically. Be respectful of websites' terms of service and privacy policies while scraping data.
